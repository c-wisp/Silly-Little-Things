## Diffmaker.bash v0.1.0
Creates diffs of local folders, mostly made to learn bash and for use in a personal backup handler, WIP as of 30-11-24

## WriteBinaryFile.c v1.0
Converts a txt file full of hex values + delims (5f 53 02...) and converts them into binary, was supposed to be part of a larger script but I ended up not needing this :p
